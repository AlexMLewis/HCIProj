	<h3>Elevator Speech</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:4em; margin-right:4em">It is our experience that many Princeton students are forced to buy books and equipment that too 
	often gets thrown out at the end of the semester or whenever it becomes useless to them. There are a 
	few existing ways students can trade their unneeded “stuff” like FREE & FOR SALE and TigerTrade however 
	to date there is no efficient, user-friendly, and popular way to trade or buy with other Princeton students. 
	This is where TigerMart hopes to make its impact: by improving on the usability of the existing TigerTrade. 
	On the TigerMart website, students will be able to log on with their netids and then post items to sell and 
	communicate with potential buyers directly on the website. We will also seek to improve the interface and search 
	ability to make the website easier for Princeton students. Our hope is that with these changes TigerMart will 
	gain the critical mass of users that TigerTrade has so far failed to acquire.</p>
