	<p>Our project aims to create an application that will improve the experience for people visiting art museums. We have noticed a few problems with the art museum space: namely, that art museum iPhone applications are generally poor in both design and content, physical maps at art museums donâ€™t sufficiently solve the problem of getting lost in a museum, and the only way to engage visitors with the art pieces is through wall plaques, tour-guides, or audio-tours. We hope to create an application that will address these problems and improve the overall museum experience for visitors.</p>
